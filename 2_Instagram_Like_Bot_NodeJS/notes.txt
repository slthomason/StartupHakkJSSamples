Alright So, we will be designing an Instagram Like Bot 
that automatically logs in to your Instagram account
 via your email and password and randomly 
 likes the posts and comments that appear on your feed.

By now, you all must be knowing the starter pack for any Nodejs project: 
Create a folder named InstaLikeBot
→ Open VSCode 
→ Open the InstaLikeBot folder
→ Create a file named instagram.js 
→ Open the terminal window and type npm init -y
→ Install the playwright library and dotenv package by typing npm install dotenv playwright 
→ Get started with the code.

Here, we would be making use of Environment Variables. 
So, install the dotenv package to create a virtual environment 
for your project by typing npm install dotenv.
Now, create a file named .env to store the 
confidential information such as username, email, password, etc.


And we’re done! Now let’s run the project by typing node instagram.js
